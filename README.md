It enables linting and linting rules specifically for React projects. It sets the browser and ES2020 environment, extends recommended configurations, and ignores certain patterns. It also enables plugins for React related checks, sets parser options, and specifies specific plugin rules for ES6, React components, and variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It imports two Google Fonts (Poppins and Sono), sets the title of the page as "The Wild Oasis", and includes a script file called "main.jsx" for further functionality. The main functionality is not evident in this code snippet alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It imports the `defineConfig` function and `react` plugin. The `defineConfig` function sets up the project configuration, while the `react` plugin enables React support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [App.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\App.jsx)                                                         | This code snippet sets up the main functionalities of a React app using React Router for page navigation, react-query for data fetching and caching, and react-query-devtools for debugging. It also provides a global dark mode context and renders various pages with protected routes. Additionally, it includes a toast notification component for displaying success and error messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [main.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\main.jsx)                                                       | The code snippet uses React and ReactDOM to render the <App /> component to the root element of the HTML document. The ReactDOM.createRoot method is used to create a root for the React application, and the render method is used to render the <App /> component within the root. Additionally, the <React.StrictMode> component is used to enable strict mode, which causes additional checks and warnings to be displayed during development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [DarkModeContext.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\context\DarkModeContext.jsx)                         | This code defines a DarkModeContext and DarkModeProvider component in a React application. It uses a custom hook called useLocalStorageState to store the dark mode state in local storage. The provider component manages toggling the dark mode and updates the HTML document's class accordingly. The useDarkMode hook is provided to easily access the dark mode context within other components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [LoginForm.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\LoginForm.jsx)                     | The code represents a login form component that is used for user authentication. It utilizes a form library called "react-hook-form" for form management, and "useLogin" hook to handle login functionality. The form includes fields for entering email and password, and a button to submit the form for login. The button is disabled while the login process is ongoing, and displays a loading spinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [LogOut.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\LogOut.jsx)                           | The code snippet includes the necessary imports and defines a function called "LogOut". The function uses a "useLogout" hook to extract the "isLogingOut" boolean and the "logout" function. It renders a ButtonIcon component with an onClick event that triggers the "logout" function. If "isLogingOut" is true, it renders a SpinnerMini component, otherwise, it renders a HiArrowRightOnRectangle icon component. The LogOut function is exported as the default component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [SignupForm.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\SignupForm.jsx)                   | The provided code snippet is a SignupForm component that utilizes the react-hook-form library to handle form validation and submission. It includes form inputs for full name, email address, password, and password confirmation. The form has error messaging for invalid fields and utilizes the useSignup hook for signing up a new user. The component also includes buttons for canceling the signup and submitting the form, with an optional loading spinner displayed during the signup process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [UpdatePasswordForm.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\UpdatePasswordForm.jsx)   | This code snippet is a form component in React using the react-hook-form library. It allows users to update their password by entering a new password and confirming it. The form performs validation on the password and password confirmation fields, and handles form submission and reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [UpdateUserDataForm.jsx](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\UpdateUserDataForm.jsx)   | This code snippet is a React component that renders a form for updating user data. It uses custom hooks-useUser and useUpdateUser-to fetch the user data and update the user. The form includes inputs for full name and avatar image, and has functionality for handling form submission and cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [useLogin.js](https://github.com/JoseAlbDR/the-wild-oasis/blob/main/src\features\authentication\useLogin.js)                         | This code snippet utilizes React Query and React Router to handle user login functionality.
